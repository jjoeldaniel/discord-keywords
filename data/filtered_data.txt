dr n vy: i bought kid icarus uprising, 3d land, link between worlds, wario land 1, and dk 94
ethanthatonekid: that is if you don’t want them to fade into the ether.
ethanthatonekid: (yes <#710225253737037836> is <#1039307766554185728>)
ethanthatonekid: so if anyone has pokémon in their pokémon bank accounts, you should transfer them to home by the end of today.
ethanthatonekid: the wii u and 3ds eshop is closing along with pokémon bank.
ethanthatonekid: also, “soon” means later today
karni: im planning to get my phoenix wright and professor layton games most likely
ethanthatonekid: so bring your 3ds to campus more often if you like streetpass lol
ethanthatonekid: i bought all of the streetpass games and some other virtual console games.
ethanthatonekid: but you can only add funds to your 3ds through your switch or nintendo website.
ethanthatonekid: only on the 3ds and wii u though. the switch eshop is still up.
dr n vy: the eshop is closing soon anyone buy some last minute games?
cheesy: dam
jaxob: no this did not prevent layoffs at apple. ceos mostly get paid in stock and salaries are probably around just 20% of their total comp(so 40% of 20%). also apple reduced headcount through converting less of their interns to ftes this year.
light151: it's a crane fly. they're harmless

ethanthatonekid: reinforcement learning.
justins: it wouldn't taint data that much. it would probably improve it. think about it. if a user used copilot and thought the output was good enough to commit+push to a repository then the code presumably works and the user is happy. if then, copilot relearns from that same data then i see it as a positive. it is learning from and writing code that users want and have shown that they want by pushing to a repo.

angus: im def gonna go look for those baja blasts energy drink my mind is blown
ashy: whos 21+
angus: i always get them in front of the the engineering building
ashy: oh theres alcoholic baja blasts in the packing house and the taco bell cantina
angus: i love these
angus: holy shihhhh i need this
ashy: are u joking me
angus: 💀💀
ashy: $30
ashy: im so sad
angus: ppl resell it
angus: they always sell out fr
angus: oh yea
ashy: and shititiri
ashy: i mean in like albertsons
angus: that’s crazyyy
angus: i thought it was always a taco bell exclusive
ashy: 🙏🙏🙏
ashy: 2019
angus: when was this wut the frick
ashy: i remember when baja bkasts were sold in all stores
ashy: i wanna cweurduciiroosmwmefxsw
angus: the problem is they always sell out instantly
angus: so when you have midnight+ cravings for the blast
angus: that’s why u gotta get the 12 pack cans of baja blast at target
ashy: i@ so sad
angus: that’s p crazy
angus: i did not know that
ashy: 4am in fullerton
angus: isn’t taco bell closed 🗿
ashy: i need someone ro dirve cuz i cant walk in the drive thru
angus: you’re right perfect baja blast time
angus: it is 2:50 in the mornin
ashy: a baja blast would hit
부미: definitely 🤞😪
부미: i will attempt this tomorrow right after work since it’s due tomorrow night 😪
dsol77: the more practice the better ig, always make sure that the eigen values are correct before you proceed tho lol
부미: i mean i have unlimited attempts but true rip
dsol77: rip
부미: yeah..
dsol77: wait did you try this on the hw?
부미: i’ll just throw my laptop outside lolol
부미: i have another eigen value that was 1… and i still didn’t get the problem right man
부미: 😭 huh but that’s only for -3
dsol77: we’ll that’s pretty much the solution. remember we changed the eigen values earlier so it’s not like it’ll produce a viable solution, it’s just for theoretical purposes
부미: i’m kind of confused of where i go from here with my parameters
부미: [  0 0 0 ]
[ -15  1  30] 
[ 0 0 0 ]
부미: hm okay so i got
부미: wait i think i did something wrong lol. me being tired i accidently pluged 3 not -3💀
부미: oh wait
부미: [  1 0 0 ]
[ 0 0 1 ] 
[ 0 0 0 ]
부미: i basically ended with
부미: or wait
부미: i end up with two like parameters right… how would i convert them into one matrix
부미: when i plug in my eigen value
부미: hmmm
dsol77: nice, glad to help. keep it up, you basically have it down 👍
부미: thanks btw! im gonna do a problem
부미: oooo wait wait let me try this now
dsol77: once we have the final vectors, we can make p
dsol77: and 3
dsol77: we repeat for eigen values 2
dsol77: that vector will be our solution for vector x1
dsol77: then we find the parameters, and then convert the parameters into a vector
dsol77: and then find the rre form
dsol77: to do that we replace  λ with 1 first
dsol77: now we're gonna plug in our eigenvalues and find the basic solutions
dsol77: remember this?
dsol77: yeah now we get to work
dsol77: anyways like i said imagine it simplified to this
부미: so then the eigen values are  1, 2, 3?
부미: yeah!
dsol77: oh yeah, sorry i overlooked that. regardless it will still be an ugly simplification
부미: isn’t it + 1?
부미: wait for this one
dsol77: because it doesn't simplify nicely
dsol77: reluctantly our professor isn't going to provide us with a difficult eigen values. i mean for ( λ^2 - 8 λ +1) to simplify the eigenvalues would return a decimal number
부미: wait do you mean + 1
dsol77: but imagine the eigen value simplified to ( λ -1) ( λ -2) ( λ -3)
dsol77: i literally just came up with this example off the top of my head so we're gonna get an ugly eigen value for ( λ^2 - 8  λ+1)
dsol77: then simplify again: ( λ-1)( λ^2 -8 λ +1)
dsol77: then simplify, it would come out to ( λ-1) ( λ^2 -8 λ + 15 - 14)
부미: okay…
dsol77: in this case, our determinant would look like ( λ -1)(-1)^4 (( λ-5)( λ-3) - (14))
nestiray: oh dang i have test on that tmr lol
부미: yeah then i get lost after finding the eigen values, like finding the eigen vectors
dsol77: i'll edit the example to make it a bit more simple. but yeah you have the right idea
부미: and then do that math with like the determinant like … lamda-1( the remaining values lolol)
dsol77: yep you could do that
부미: the second column
부미: yeah you choose like for instance
dsol77: simple. find the determinant
dsol77: how do you do that?
dsol77: exactly
부미: yesss and from there you find the eugen values right
dsol77: [ λ -5   0  -7 ]
[-9    λ-1     0]
[-2    0     λ-3]
dsol77: subtracting that from a would result in:
부미: yeah😭😭 don’t worry
dsol77: pretend that's alligned lol
부미: yeah
dsol77: the identiy eigen matrix would just be 
[ λ   0  0 ]
[0   λ    0]
[0    0   λ]
부미: yeah the 3x3 ones are so hard for eigen vectors
dsol77: [ 5   0   7 ]
[9   1    0]
[2    0   3]
부미: https://tenor.com/view/sad-cat-gif-26527456
dsol77: let's say a is a 3 x 3 matrix. a would look something like
dsol77: to sum it up, first you multiply an identity matrix by the eigen value and subtract it by a.
dsol77: they look intimidating af, but they’re actually much easier than they seem
jasonw: boushra "powder outledge" bettir
부미: didnt figure it out
부미: yep
daniel truong: someone mentioned eigen vectors??
they shouldn't pachuco: leaving campus that bright flash of lighting made a visit

jasonw: ah, you could ask if he's teaching it next semester?
awesomeaj5: i have velasco rn for 490 and that's what his is like. it doesn't say who's teaching 491  next semester so i'm trying to see if there are professors who actually make people show up and stuff
jasonw: her 491's the exact same
jasonw: do u have lidia rn?
awesomeaj5: just curious, for 491 do you go to the actual class a lot? like for 490 we show up maybe 4 times in the semester and i was just wondering if its the same for 491

jasonw: and stop losing my dms when i use the search function
jasonw: just pick a database and stick w it
jasonw: i just know they went from mongo -> cassandra -> sylla like bro
seb !!: either that or it will just dump and reinitialize
seb !!: idk about all that, its more or less the app crashing unexpectedly commonly
jasonw: and stop writing a blog post every month about their shiny new database
jasonw: i just want them to not lose my fucking messages
jasonw: literally i do not care what database they are using
seb !!: dawg it needs to be more stable
seb !!: discord keeps tryna make their app launch faster…

peekoe: if you can’t remember the number how will you remember the order?
ashy: just gonna get the numbers randomly tattooed on me and only i will know the order

peekoe: or get it tattooed on your forearm
peekoe: 🙏

daniel truong: but never on application
daniel truong: usually they ask ssn for background check or security clearance
light151: some companies ask for ssns as part of a background check. kaiser's official faq states that (under general employment):
https://www.kaiserpermanentejobs.org/faqs#:~:text=the%20ssn%20is%20used%20to,work%20in%20the%20united%20states.
daniel truong: ask for ssn on application sounds weird
dino1: for an internship application
dino1: yeah
daniel truong: is that a company
dino1: is that weird?
dino1: kaiser permanente is asking for ssn
konodioda: ah

daniel truong: depend on class, comp ethics will be mostly essay, also 490,491
konodioda: or mostly just coding stuff
konodioda: is there stuff like writing papers?
konodioda: but hw-wise
konodioda: ah
daniel truong: upper divs course expect u to know coding so they wont spend time explaining again the concept from lower divs

daniel truong: pc <:angy:1022210952340443156>
ashy: i used my pc its fun
daniel truong: running unreal on my mac seems like pain
ashy: i have a grad student shes the best
ashy: 386 is good w mccarthy if u wanna learn unreal, or if you don’t wanna learn much cuz he gives u all the code. 349 its kinda self learning i really like it cuz its more freedom not really constrained to making a certain website or anything like game design ur doin the same proj as everyone else
daniel truong: and i havent heard a good thing abt mccarthy yet
daniel truong: 349 it’s either dr.avery or dr.mccarthy
daniel truong: 411 if u lucky u’ll get dr.paul for swift ios
blaze: and this 😂😂
blaze: mainly learn but more hands on
daniel truong: party
ashy: idk what u want tho in a class

joel: of all the drinks that one could pour,
there is one that i adore,
it's not expensive, quite cheap, in fact,
but its taste, to me, is a perfect match.

it's called mountain dew baja blast,
a drink so good, it's hard to surpass.
a hint of lime, a touch of flavor,
it's a drink i always seek to savor.

with every sip, i feel renewed,
it's like a blast of dewy goodness, 
mountain dew baja blast, oh how i love thee,
you're a treat that's always there for me.

seb !!: idk how, but me and my friends got chatgpt to give up last night
pillow: ur right
pillow: holy shit
joel: a simple request like “hi how are you” can at times take around 11 seconds
joel: rate limits were sort of random but i think it’s more of a rate limit for overall usage as well as performance issues

awesomeaj5: so looking at the courses for the fall and we have 352 this semester (cryptography). i'm not much of a whiz with security but anybody have an idea what that would be like? trying to choose electives based off the professors and i saw gofman there lol

sle007: *for getting an internship
sle007: real industry work > personal project > nothing

blaze: dang ok all good i’ll try and look around my house maybe i just misplaced them
angus: me and ethan did a check of the room to make sure no one forgot anything (bc people always forget like hydro flasks or random stuff) i don’t think i saw any glasses
blaze: pls lmk if you found them my vision is rlly bad 🙏
blaze: i was sitting in the front row and may have left them there

jiink: okey, thank you!
daniel truong: ^
bigo: most likely afternoon
karni: once it's set in stone we'll update the information
karni: we havent decided yet
jiink: what is the start and end hour of fullyhacks? like, apr 8 8:00 am to apr 9 8:00 am, or what?
joel: i feel like there were better examples to showcase
joel: they made a discord bot
joel: their livestream was okay
ethanthatonekid: hype https://youtu.be/txkjmx0kys0
daniel truong: i see your application so you're good, you should be able to access your user portal now
daniel truong: did u click the button multiple times, cause it might have denied your request
prime: just sent in my application. hoping for the best 🙏
daynger808: nvm got it
daynger808: i think it bugged out a few times on my phone
daynger808: how do i tell if my fullyhacks application went through?
daniel truong: neolang
ethanthatonekid: neopets energy
jasonw: should be those instructions tho
jasonw: touch bar moment
ct: i don’t have an f5 button lol
jasonw: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-clang-mac
jasonw: are you referring to the f5 run button?
ct: has anyone changed the version of c++ the vscode uses for mac? i can't compile lambas unless i use: ```g++ -std=c++17 {filename}``` would like to be able to just use the runcode button
trung: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
trung: why release paper at that point
trung: basically it's impossible to replicate gpt-4
jasonw: tell gpt to summarize it
trung: in summary they didn't realease how they trained the model, how many parameters,...
daniel truong: aint reading all that
trung: <:lulw:662018905107071007>
trung: "open"ai btw
trung: https://cdn.openai.com/papers/gpt-4.pdf
jasonw: gpt got dumber ever since they let the general population train it w chatgpt
daniel truong: they’ll dumb down gpt-3 like what apple did to their old iphone
jasonw: gpt 3 was just a front to sell gpt 4
trung: <:pepega:795044889758662686>
trung: who wants me to waste $20 this month for gpt4 ?
freshac: another w for the react gang
daniel truong: never thought i'd make a game using react native
daniel truong: this is pretty cool
daniel truong: https://youtu.be/hfgtyd5nmwq
seb !!: the fact that it has visual integration tho is quite big
seb !!: i was wondering whats the pricing, i couldn’t get in
joel: 0.002 per 750 words for gpt3 and 0.06 for gpt4
joel: gpt4 so pricy
seb !!: https://tenor.com/view/berries-n-creme-little-lad-funny-jig-gif-10576612
seb !!: oh sorry, ill do a lil jig
daniel truong: mood killer
seb !!: csuf florida experience
seb !!: its warm and raining and humid
daniel truong: it works!
jasonw: jasonw test inc 😶
karni: will consider moving it avoid it for next time!
jasonw: that u won't be able to show up and lose to me this year
karni: definitely always next year
jasonw: that sounds like a tragedy
부미: https://tenor.com/view/cat-meme-scream-shout-sad-gif-24329881
부미: there’s always next year
부미: rip fullyhacks is during ramadan
karni: wonder who that could be
jasonw: sounds like an issue whos main cause is very highly likely attributed to a lack of skill
karni: edit it and send again should work
karni: ufkc
daniel truong: need to send this great embedd that discord announcement doesnt show
daniel truong: https://fullyhacks.acmcsuf.com/
jasonw: 😶
daniel truong: why r u a hater
jasonw: guy really said largest hackathon when its only competition was the mini hackathon
karni: im crying
karni: right?
daniel truong: damn they be releasing model like iphone
jasonw: i mean id probably pass the bar exam if i had the whole internet memorized too 😶
seb !!: they use ‘pass the bar exam’ as a metric now 👀
seb !!: do you have to pay? it says exclusively on gpt+
seb !!: oh shiz

seb !!: ‘oh you need this generation 8 core cpu and a $600 gpu reccomended to play this game/run this app’
seb !!: that’s literally how some applications ‘fix’ optimizing and it pisses me off
pillow: just like how you can add more lanes to a freeway and fix traffic
pillow: the solution is so clear
pillow: like just add more bits cmon
angus: yoooooooo for real
pillow: when they dropping the 128 bit ints

angus: epic
angus: it right
angus: said dis
angus: chatgpt
ct: might be a stupid question, but is a struct considered a data structure, and if so are data structures and objects synonymous?
cheesy: it looked fine on my m1
joel: yeah if you're m1 you might have some problems but if you have an intel it should be pretty easy
cheesy: ok ty
joel: for mac, best bet is probably utm
cheesy: fuck the auto correct
cheesy: mac
cheesy: max
cheesy: max
cheesy: max
joel: for windows or mac?
joel: what app
cheesy: at the linux fair?
cheesy: what was the app used to set up linux

alieb: it is fixed
alieb: dm me
sle007: <@262459121914085377> <@131555215555035136> i think the 1 test case for part b is wrong

daniel truong: the end.
daniel truong: if u love css, u love tailwind
seb !!: https://tenor.com/view/zane-ninjago-lego-ninjago-death-fail-gif-22975365
jasonw: write less do more : )
jasonw: also js framework enjoyers in shambles when they find out the website is coded w jquery
jasonw: tailwind is i care so much about css that i remove the default css from literally every html element so i can manually style all of it 🫢
jasonw: tailwind is the opposite of idgaf about css wtf
daniel truong: wait until u try tailwind
joel: time for me to ditch bootstrap
joel: heard of it but never tried
joel: oh wow pico css seems cool
_diamondburned_: i'm proud
jasonw: the idgaf abt css css library 😶
jiink: pico.css looks great why have i never seen this before
pillow: the most rigorous stress test known to man
jasonw: it seemed to pass the jasonw test xd
alieb: you were the only stress test :d
jasonw: i wasnt very gentle w the website when justin asked me to test it 😶
jasonw: no reason stated in the article but "that was quick" sounded like u knew something so
seb !!: sus
seb !!: and karni pointed out, this was quite a bit ago
seb !!: no reason stated
jasonw: huh for what
daniel truong: she's fired
seb !!: <:catthink:526983414226747393>

bigo: bruh they literally advertise themselves as a better cassandra 😂

seb !!: so to answer your question: they aren’t both immediately comparable as ‘what’s easier to get a job in’- they differ in what you do, expect, interact with
seb !!: web dev has trended a bit to be outsourced in recent years, so ontop of your peers you’re also competing with other regions, digitally, so that’s another aspect to consider, altho it’s not as ‘crazy’ as a concern that some people shout
seb !!: there’s a big market for that in the us, however it does taper a lot in other markets due to apple not being as a big of a player, something to consider if you’re trying to be a bit nomadic
seb !!: also- ios development, like are you talking about all apple’s os? macos, tv, ios, etc
seb !!: ime (what i’ve seen for people gunning for both) both are competitive, but both obviously have their own markets that are trending different directions
ethanthatonekid: a/b test the resume?
karni: both are competitive
dino1: random thought, but if you were equally skilled in full stack web dev and ios development. which is easier to get a job in?
blaze: yea i was having issues hella i'm coming back gotta redownload discord on my pc lmao
joel: <@771129946865270844> is ur mic not working
jasonw: just dont get caught smile
seb !!: but yeah to the person who originally asked, that's why i asked what specifically bc there are some 'converters' for proprietary types out there
seb !!: \:(
dns: with copyright law and stuff
dns: yup re is a touchy subject
seb !!: it got a lot of people flagged once it was taken down \:,(
dns: ah yeah that was definitely a cool effort
seb !!: i did get interested in it once with club penguin rewritten and i was in their discord, but that's also not exactly 1:1
seb !!: no, yeah i don't do any of that due to level of complexity
dns: it's cool work to make progress on, but it's just a huge task lol
dns: which is why i was confused/amazed to hear that was your goal with ur game
dns: this is what i would call "porting" i guess
dns: this is not that
dns: reads thatt
dns: your emulator
dns: a n64 rom
dns: so if you have like
dns: ur "emulating" the target architecture
dns: there's no rebuilding happening in emulation
dns: isn't emulation
dns: ur definition
dns: no sorry like
seb !!: nono, i'm saying as example
dns: this isn't emulation
seb !!: what i'm describing is ship of theseus, grabbing as much as i can from the 'original' iteration and then remaking it on a new platform
seb !!: a good example is more like this is more emulation, ie rebuilding a game entirely in it's 'true form' to run as intended on linux
seb !!: no, this is i guess
dns: and it took a ton (a ton) of people a lot of time to get close to right
dns: with the goal of getting it to build
dns: like here's a proper decompilation of an older game than what you mentioned
dns: https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64
dns: reconstructing games for a target platform is a rlly nontrivial task
dns: i guess when you say "doing it" im still not rlly sure what you're reversing
seb !!: for simpson's hit & run there's essentially a 'guide' on youtube (it's really just a video of a guy doing it, not a tutorial) so that one was decently easy
dns: gotcha
seb !!: not rlly a 'port'
seb !!: like tbh it's really just re-making the game un unreal engine
seb !!: oh
dns: what does that mean
dns: like when you say you're porting it to ue
dns: no that was a question
seb !!: like i was able to get most of the decals, bumpmap, etc, but a bit of textures, audio, code (obv) wasn't able to
seb !!: there's a good hunk that's avi to port pretty decently, but you also need to redo a lot of it due to proprietary filetypes and whatnot
seb !!: kinda
dns: wdym porting?
seb !!: most recently was porting simpsons hit and run to ue
seb !!: tbh most of the stuff is burried/deleted bc i drop stuff a lot
seb !!: it's just a single file?
dns: sounds like fun
dns: feel free to dm more info and i can give suggestions
bradley: ohhh ghidra ive seen this before thanks for mentioning
dns: also can't share im assuming
bradley: and i have a string constant i know is present within
seb !!: there are some 'custom' programs that directly convert proprietary formats to common ones, but those a bit rare, i had to do a bit of guesswork to get stuff to properly work, or if not at least get *some* of it to work and then 'redo' some stuff
bradley: im trying to at least decode a file
seb !!: nothing i can release, however, due to copyright
seb !!: just depends, i'm weird(/maybe mental) to where i cling and drop things a lot. i ripped some files from various games to 'port' them over as models, or objects, and i've done stuff like try to remake them on ue5
joel: <:bruh:1037080444782518303>
jasonw: im at 7leaves rn kdfjhsdkjhfdf

jasonw: cus it had me install java
jasonw: i started crying before i opend ghidra actually
dns: that's the first step to greatness
jasonw: i just open ghidra and start crying
dns: im curious, with what?
dns: pretty broad question but yeah i do
jasonw: christoss
karni: i dont mean to consistently ping you anytime i see something security related sorry haha i just had a feeling you would probably know best
karni: maybe <@238025918411440130> does?

karni: so somewhat actually
karni: imagine advent of code
sle007: is the daily "coding challenge" more like algo-ish or what is it like?
karni: a lot of people are uninterested and unwilling to try new things when we're so used to our comfort zone but it's a really great opportunity to learn something you are potentially interested in
karni: who has a lot of experience and is going to really give you a step into learning something new
karni: haha no um but the best person to explain this would be <@238025918411440130>
grizzlyy: is capture the flag the same concept?

grizzlyy: i’ll probably attend
karni: nah
grizzlyy: gotcha seems really interesting. are groups required
karni: (stay tuned for a larger hackathon held by acm 👀)
karni: legitimate hackathons will have a bit more such as like workshops and whatnot
karni: and it just honestly helps people start on a project
karni: then you try to push out an mvp within the given hour
karni: youre presented with a theme maybe to start off your project
karni: getting together in groups if you'd like
karni: also this is a mini hackathon so it's just like
karni: program

seb !!: i found it out, but its real tricky tricky sneaky sneaky peaky
seb !!: like i’ve noticed tesla and now intel unison does this, same methodology, and i’m not finding any documentation how they do it but it seems like when connected by bluetooth ios devices can push-push notifications to the connected bluetooth device and if allowed in iphone settings, reply to texts.
seb !!: also does anyone know what process that push notifications operate on over bluetooth for ios devices?
seb !!: thats a big gig, i have a friend in sj but they’re in a different biz
seb !!: are you?

karni: you owe me money if you dont come
cheesy: lol
cheesy: so happy it’s friday tmrw
reflex._: okay got it! thank you for the clarification!
karni: if you just say "particpated in hackathon" it doesnt really give much
karni: by all means put it on your resume but
karni: by mini hackathon we're just having an environment for everyone to come together and work on a project that an mvp can be possibly pushed out in two hours
karni: the point of a hackathon is to program something or at least try to start on a project that can potentially be improved upon later
karni: well what exactly would you put
reflex._: (sorry for the noob question)
reflex._: this would be my first hackathon, so when you say if i make something, does that mean a finished product? because i was just under the impression that you could put a hackathon on your resume if you participated in it?
cheesy: yessir
cheesy: <a:flashsonic:862019340747931649>
karni: i mean if you make something from it
reflex._: would the mini hackathon that acm is hosting be something that i would be able to put on my resume? 😅

seb !!: mornin
ct: thank you... for whatever reason ```.rotate_image {
  transform: rotate(270deg);
}``` affects the spacing of my container... had to put the item i rotated in the middle for it to even on both sides
jasonw: im gunna sleep now tho im sure some other css wizard will answer u eventually
jasonw: ur space evenly is gonna overwrite ur center idk if thats intended
ct: i have 1 row using the same class that looks evenly spaced and one that doesn't
ct: i'm just jumping into learning css today, so idk if this really makes sense but its what i got so far lol
ct: ```.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;

  justify-content: space-evenly;
}

[flex-child] {
  display: flex;

  flex: 1;
}```
ct: ok cool, do you know if transform affects flexbox? im having a hard time getting items aligned
jasonw: id say flexbox and grid r like ur bread and butter for positioning shit on the screen
ct: for css is flexbox what relevant rn? or should i be learning something else?
joel: just only by credits
joel: technically i am

seb !!: not only that, but there’s the psychological aspect
cheesy: it’s like they don’t wanna😭
cheesy: they suck at answering calls

cheesy: ty
cheesy: i’ll tell ‘em that lol
cheesy: aight
karni: like sara said maybe wait a bit or just reach out to someone
cheesy: he got the approval already for the form
cheesy: march 2
karni: ^ always reach out to someone when in doubt
karni: how long has it been/
ebyemjc1: he should talk to records and registration
cheesy: for tda and they said they would update it or some
cheesy: and he just wondering why it hasn’t updated
cheesy: bc it hasn’t updated
cheesy: i’m not changing
karni: scared of?
cheesy: bc he scared
cheesy: no friend asking
ebyemjc1: yes, maybe a week or less
karni: you changing your major?
wesley: a lot easier with leafs
cheesy: anyone ever change they major/minor. how long does it take for tda to update?
wesley: its hard for the fiat cuz its such a low volume 😦
seb !!: the batteries are always gonna be the most pricey part, but you *can* get recycled cells/2nd life
seb !!: i mean like everything aside from batteries themselves
wesley: i think its around 6k in the minimum for a leaf cell swap
seb !!: if you’re in the mind of, “how can i extend the life of this car since i own it” versus the mind of, “this vehicle costs much to get upto spec, its better to sell it for what its worth”
wesley: the prius battery is like 1kw tho
seb !!: chrisfix did a prius battery rebuild on one of his videos, i recall the cost wasn’t *too* astronomical
seb !!: <:shrug:883044098506899486> entirely depends on your evaluation
wesley: a lot of gen 1 leafs with 40kw batteries don't get fair insurance payouts
wesley: yeah but from a financial standpoint even if the labor is free it's prob not worth it lol
seb !!: mostly swapping cells, replacing thermal sensors, the works
seb !!: it’s not all wrench work though, you’re dealing with high voltage of course
seb !!: you could totally do it with insight from the sae folks in the engineering community here, even better if you can snuggle into the buggy builder people
seb !!: https://electriccarbatteryreplacement.com/fiat-500e/
seb !!: harder, but possible
wesley: its a fiat 500e
wesley: oh we had a gen 1 leaf before but didn't keep it cuz the lack of active cooling
seb !!: you can
seb !!: gen 1 leaf?
bigo: got turned down 😔
wesley: i mean my current lithium battery gets me 65 miles of range on a good day and the car is essentially worth nothing so would be fun to self build a new one
blaze: check email they just sent me one back
daynger808: man i would have applied but i missed the deadline. how do you guys find out about hackathons?
seb !!: (you probably could never due to needing specific environments and equipment, but imagine)
seb !!: imagine, you can grow your own battery
seb !!: that’s so scifi and radical to me
ebyemjc1: yeah, they already exist super cool, these are my notes from way back when in bio 302 
ever since learned about them thought hugh it would be a cool car battery

i miss bio, i don't understand a thing in computer science, how do y'all do it?
angus: so b on lookout
angus: they started sending out replies today
bigo: i applied but haven’t heard back
seb !!: i think fungus even ‘self-repair’ so
seb !!: that would be so cool
seb !!: that would be amazing, like using it in lieu of a traditional lithium battery?
blaze: anyone going to la hacks? 👀
seb !!: https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2023/company/porsche-efuels-pilot-plant-haru-oni-chile-synthetic-fuels-behind-the-scenes-31167.html
ebyemjc1: yeah but your referring to actual feul i'm more referring to a sustainable battery

seb !!: https://tenor.com/view/rogue-one-verge-of-greatness-gif-13754250
seb !!: they made e-fuel but it uses carbon and water
ebyemjc1: now all we need is microbial fuel cell powered cars and we'd be set
angus: dang rip
bigo: damn i just ended my workout 😭
seb !!: being less volatile, less fallible and needing much less energy
seb !!: they use the fungus in place of ram in testing, and it shows promising results

jaxob: i’ve decided that this fits best in <#745797700582375465> let’s move discussion of this type to this channel moving forward 🙂
they shouldn't pachuco: morning, but good
seb !!: so far my focus has been on qa internship, as i've read quite a bit as how that is a much greater 'grassroots' ladder to pm rather than trying to apply head-on (altho this was obviously taken from people's blog posts, articles, so entirely subjective)
seb !!: i see quite a lot of pm internships across the board, and there are a few overlaps, however i am curious if it would be beneficial to me if i were to land a pm internship for something less specialized in the tech field (say a projector company, smart appliances, smart general appliances)
seb !!: <@328631579406761984> hey, i was wondering if you believe in a difference between a tech field and a more broader 'consumer product tech' for product management internships.
seb !!: we did it guys

daniel truong: a / (1/2)
jasonw: do u use a * 2 or a << 1
daniel truong: i'll beat ur ass if i found a += -5 in your codebase
pillow: disagree
gabeg: well yeah i get why but it just makes whoever is reading your code life a lot harder lmaoo
daniel truong: ^ that's also a -= 5 btw
karni: im crying
daniel truong: how bout this
```
a = (a + (a * -1)) + (-5 * (a / a)) + ((a * -1) ** (a % 2))
```
jasonw: i used to deliberately write my for loops as i = i + 1
dino1: the more hoops their brain goes through the better
pillow: checkmate
pillow: you need an overload for it
pillow: i told you += happens on negative ints
dino1: i like confusing anyone who reads my code
pillow: <@372179531215405056> see

karni: i saw an individual
donald_: ok
joel: probably <#745456552718106654> if its homework related
donald_: idk where to put this question, its for operating systems
seb !!: also i see a position with playstation sony for swe in san diego
donald_: maybe
seb !!: idk if its a great idea, but at least you'll be all like, "yeah man ive had a job in it" while also getting reduced tuition or whatever
donald_: they hae internships?
seb !!: have u maybe tried csuf it dept
seb !!: that's like super competitive
seb !!: o
donald_: swe
seb !!: what position are you looking to
donald_: its so difficult to pass an interview, but even more difficult to get one..
seb !!: we need to only get lucky once, they need to get lucky everyday
seb !!: in the words of the ira
donald_: i haven't got a single interview yet 😭
karni: hope you get it!
seb !!: i catered the rez and the cover letter for it
seb !!: feeling nerves but <:shrug:883044098506899486>
seb !!: applied to da internship 👍
seb !!: https://tenor.com/view/sorry-sad-puppy-eyes-agnes-despicable-me-gif-15556208
karni: we have channels for a reason jus sayin
seb !!: hall monitor
karni: idk why the convo is happening here lmao
karni: we have <#745714911056756849> for a reason
karni: provide the github links
dino1: sorry i was driving, but yeah i totally agree with you on the eduction part. i was under the impression of putting skills at the top bc employers regard your technical skills highly. could be totally wrong.

im thinkings to use your tip of listing by importance and list in this order:

header
experience
projects
educ
skills

then ima get rid of the hyper links for the projects. should i just assume theyll look at my github? or provide actual https links next to the project name. then drop the lead full stack shit.
seb !!: thats just my viewpoint, entirely subjective
seb !!: some people have like the contradictive viewpoint: you wanna make your resume 'peak' since the well kempt companies will have the most provisions for all situations, but as a freshman student, i think it's safer to babyproof everything
dino1: yeah haha tbh i haven’t really been considering that
seb !!: ironically you wanna make sure ur resume gets thru the autobots™️ before considering a human person
seb !!: just a consideration
seb !!: i dont know either
dino1: no way i didnt know that
seb !!: cuz if the bots get confused, ur just auto-declined
seb !!: that might be something to consider
seb !!: idk if hyperlinks go thru properly on companie's auto-scanner for resumes
seb !!: you have *much* more projects than the typical freshman
seb !!: from my scouring of resume help guides, i also:
- put skills last
- put education 2nd last
seb !!: also, sometimes continuing jobs can be an ill on your resume because they might flag you for having other commitments
seb !!: and either list by chronological or importance
seb !!: not an expert, but would put everything under one cat of 'experience' rather than seperate
dino1: just need to finish my current one to replace it
dino1: gonna get rid of aimhub cause i dropped the project
dino1: then just have aimlabs under projects
dino1: and also when i worked for that crypto thing
dino1: should i move the freelance under experience?
dino1: yeah i needa drop that
_diamondburned_: for some reason there's a "lead fullstack developer" thing there despite the project only having the involvement of one person
_diamondburned_: oh they are actually projects
_diamondburned_: also wouldn't rely on pdfs to be clickable
_diamondburned_: they moreso belong under experience along with professional experience which probably shouldn't be its own section either
_diamondburned_: your proejcts section doesn't seem to contain projects
_diamondburned_: huh neat
dino1: been self taught for about a year
dino1: just recently switched to cs
dino1: im not exactly a freshman
dino1: ill send it in resume
_diamondburned_: being a freshman, i'm not sure what kind of resume you have right now
_diamondburned_: also polish up your resumes
_diamondburned_: you should definitely still apply
dino1: wait what year are you guys?
dino1: make projects in the meantime
dino1: prob just wait till next hiring season
they shouldn't pachuco: ha google
joel: probably wont get a response if you're applying to something like google swe haha but there some for you
karni: yeah you can try applying for that like joel said
joel: not sure which you are applying for tho
joel: there are underclassmen oriented internships
dino1: is it worth to keep applying?
dino1: thats what ive been assuming
karni: it's mostly for juniors
karni: i mean yeah youre literally a freshman
dino1: been applying but barely getting interviews
dino1: this my first semester as cs
dino1: how much harder is it now to get an internship vs like 2 years ago
jasonw: xd
seb !!: corro or caus
jasonw: i will say tho none of my gpt cover letters have gotten me an interview so far 💀
commodore jellyfish: gsame dev companies eat that up
seb !!: https://tenor.com/view/robert-redford-jeremiah-johnson-nodding-yes-nod-of-approval-gif-21066931
commodore jellyfish: nah fr
seb !!: they’ll be like
seb !!: cuz if you’re like, “yeah im a nerd, thats why i applied for you, u made this”
seb !!: i think vulnerability plays into it
seb !!: goated
jasonw: all recruiters wondering why every application suddenly have a cover letter when none use to 🫢
commodore jellyfish: my current job rn was impressed i listed animes they worked on in the past that i vaguely knew abt
seb !!: if anyone reads it, i hope they go

https://youtu.be/f8myli3pgoc
commodore jellyfish: if they read it theyre gonna be like yoooo
commodore jellyfish: smart
commodore jellyfish: lol lowkey yeah
seb !!: no, i’m even putting in company-specific quip just for the lulz
jasonw: put one cus everyones gonna be gpt generating one smile
seb !!: not to mention my catered-specific resume, and soon to be cover letter
seb !!: the position im looking for- typically i don’t *think* that cs majors apply for, so i’m hoping that it will be a yuge plus
seb !!: i’m not giving them anything to immediately disqual
seb !!: one hundred thousand percent
commodore jellyfish: also cause ppl in game dev usually read it cause competitive
commodore jellyfish: i always put a cover letter cause even if they dont read it it gives me a leg up on someone who has the name credentials as me but didnt write one
seb !!: if i can score this internship it’d be yuge
seb !!: i’m not gonna take that propability
daniel truong: nah i never put cover letter
seb !!: https://tenor.com/view/spongebob-the-essay-hilarious-haha-gif-3565665
seb !!: reddit says that:
1. they are never read
2. but if you don't include one, your odds of being skipped increase
seb !!: place im tryna intern at optionally asks for a cover letter
seb !!: oh ok sowwy
donald_: i have the slides already. but thanks
donald_: yea
seb !!: i might be able to get u the slides if that helps

karni: yeah but it’s better random than to like
pillow: still random
joel: yeah but thats client features vs server features
pillow: sucks nuts

pillow: i wish you could apply for test features tho
karni: nah i don’t need that lol

pillow: im saying this seperately
joel: the jda server is pretty huge
pillow: no its 100% random i know
joel: its somewhat random
karni: as in there’s too many people
karni: it’s because our server is too big

seb !!: a passthru box, and its like a switch where you click ‘display computer 1’ and all the monitors switch over, and vice verse or something
seb !!: its like
jiink: ohh i think my dad's monitor supports that. that's the thing that lets you do splitscreen with 2 pcs or switch between them right?
seb !!: idk too much about it, but it sounds pretty amazing if i could understand how it works for my mac mini
seb !!: idk its like this thing that lets you ‘share’ displays with different computers
hallowsyves: whats kvm
seb !!: i found out about them thru a meme and i'm curious as how it works :0

seb !!: i'm putting it as my last work exp i guess
seb !!: qa
karni: lmao what position is this
seb !!: i'm jotting it as exp since they explicitly ask for it
seb !!: would that be experience or skills
wesley: i mean yes it doesn't hurt
seb !!: serious question - the position im applying for lists 'game mod development, game james, or hobbyist game development' as a big plus, should i list the years that i owned & operated gmod servers? 💀
jasonw: not to look for passwords
karni: yeah i mean i would
wesley: isn't that like the first thing someone would open
jasonw: u can hide it in a folder called nsfw so no one knows to look there for it
karni: it's the truth
karni: i have nothing to say actually
karni: hey listen
jasonw: not a literal sticky note
karni: still secure tho right?
jasonw: o
karni: i can pull up those sticky notes on my phone
seb !!: y'all joke but lectures in the cs/egnr building be rancid sometimes
karni: coz like
karni: it's on cloud tho
jasonw: 🫢
wesley: u sure it wasn't coming from yourself?
seb !!: https://tenor.com/view/wtf-what-what-i-just-read-gif-20766315
jasonw: my story aboutta be about how i went to karni and smelled her sweat from monday in her sweater on friday
cheesy: 💯
cheesy: 🧢 social engineering can occur in this scenario
seb !!: i believe if you are willing to share your story, you’ve already kinda mentally braced yourself to be out there
jasonw: most secure password manager cus it's offline and cannot be hacked smile
cheesy: <a:2675povyouarehumppillow1:1079649264726196294>
karni: i forgot lmfao
karni: oh
jiink: your cursed sticky note
karni: i did?
cheesy: <:8072patrikhot:1034887003407392908>

wesley: time to hack
wesley: you showed us all ur passwords
karni: i can.
cheesy: ?
jiink: i think she can
wesley: if we all spam memes she can't stop us all
cheesy: 😭
karni: i said no memes in general
karni: and i wrote the rules
karni: i actually looked too
cheesy: i actually looked
cheesy: y’all got my ass
jiink: read rule 7
karni: no memes in general
wesley: fullerton farter got some competition
jasonw: she renewing her non binary license with me
cheesy: double it and give it to the next person
karni: did you assume my gender
jiink: girls don't fart
karni: prob true ngl
karni: honestly
bigo: https://tenor.com/view/family-guy-woah-hold-up-wait-gif-5693923
jasonw: i heard karni fart in the meeting once and it was stinky
karni: im gonna charge you $20 on his behalf
cheesy: ☠️
cheesy: charge him $20 for that comment 💯
karni: woah that's too far
cheesy: 🧢
wesley: "i hate acm"
karni: lmao what you gonna submit
cheesy: jeeps are nice
wesley: can we submit a confession as karni
cheesy: damn
karni: or like 60k+ idk
karni: yeah but does it matter? there's like 40k+ students in this school
wesley: jeep 4xe
cheesy: what plug in hybrid we talking about
jasonw: i cant be the only one that thinks that it's a little bit unsettling that theres 1 singular person that knows the identity of everyone sending these shit in
wesley: u can't even unlock the chargers without a charging account so its not like they thought it was "fake charging"
seb !!: ah, okay
seb !!: and i dont put that lightly
wesley: i'm pretty sure they didn't have a supplemental ev permit but either way the ticket was written for a wrong reason
seb !!: csufconfessions is pretty untame until its truama-inducing
jasonw: ive noticed a lot of posts about either
1. i dont know how to make friends
2. omg i saw college students having sex
3. i hate x professor or y ta
4. gastronome food sucks
karni: i cant imagine what they say
karni: im not following that
jasonw: and the csufconfession insta
seb !!: i still am confused with mastadon but i get the basics
seb !!: are we rotating to mastadon or bluesky
seb !!: in other news
karni: the redditors can be kinda wack sometimes
karni: good point tho
karni: hm
seb !!: idk why they got a ticket, they never said
karni: is that the reason?
karni: but still why did they get charged?
karni: that makes sense
seb !!: especially with the more ‘affordable’ electric cars, like the bolt or leaf, which don’t have much range
seb !!: i was just pointing out that, that person could use gas anytime they want, and they’re slowcharging on a plug that someone with a fully electric car might need
seb !!: i wasn’t saying ‘no u cant’ or saying it shouldn’t be allowed
seb !!: no no like thats what i mean
karni: i didnt know that honestly
karni: ?
karni: wait so a plug in hybrid cant be at an ev spot/
seb !!: i remember someone took a pic of them getting a ticket at an ev charger, and i pointed out that they were charging a plug-in hybrid at an ev spot, where some students rely on it to get home and i was ‘downvoted’ to hell 💀
karni: i dont even look ngl it seems that way
karni: im not sure what to do in this situation either
seb !!: no
karni: it's up to you to give it to the police definitenly
karni: im very glad you werent hurt
karni: college students cant drive but im not justifying that
seb !!: good points
jaxob: csu reddits are just wild in general ngl
seb !!: fair
karni: i understand what you mean by awareness but everyone has experienced it at one point ngl
karni: i feel like a lot of people post on there just to rake in karma
karni: the csuf reddit can be really toxic especially with them posting and spreading things and people can look into it and start bullying and harrassing others
seb !!: 🤷
seb !!: or i’ll just do nothing
seb !!: true, but it’s more so the actual live experience instead of just word of mouth
karni: idk people are pretty aware everyone is shit at driving
seb !!: i’s rather have awareness than justice
seb !!: 🤷🏽‍♂️
karni: uploading it to reddit doesnt really do anything tho
seb !!: it was a younger girl, i believe it was a gray camry iirc
seb !!: https://youtu.be/2bfnyfdqmek
daniel truong: <:flushedfrank:971161832372985916>
daniel truong: and turn out that person is me
seb !!: compromise
seb !!: maybe ill upload it to the reddit and block out their face and playe
daniel truong: should have let them hit and get the $$$
seb !!: ik that person was probably like late to class and stressed and all and like i know that they totally couldve hit me and i might have been hurt but idk
hallowsyves: they did almost hit you
daniel truong: next time then
hallowsyves: i mean
seb !!: it feels petty
seb !!: idk
daniel truong: i think u can report it to uni police if u want
seb !!: my car logs all emergency braking events
seb !!: its recorded
daniel truong: time to buy dash cam
seb !!: my car’s emergency braking triggered and i slammed on the pedal
seb !!: i was on my way out at the stop sign, oncoming traffic turns right, i went ahead to make my left turn (i know that i *shouldve* completely waited to clear it) and the person behind the car that was turning right decided to gun it and almost hit me
daniel truong: some guys almost ran me over while i was walking down
daniel truong: yeah mf be driving crazy
seb !!: exiting parking structure yeah
daniel truong: in the parking structure?
seb !!: kinda wanna make a reddit post but also dont wanna like be petty over something that like in the end didnt happen
seb !!: someone almost nailed me pretty bad with their car yesterday
hallowsyves: 4?!?!?
_diamondburned_: i used latex + markdown for all 4 of my calc classes
_diamondburned_: that's yikes
seb !!: gi
hallowsyves: hi
daniel truong: 😶
daniel truong: lolol
ct: but i’m probably faster writing than typing a new language too so probably not losing out too much rn
angus: get this man an energy drink fr
angus: <@632347645201088513>
angus: bruh danny really going ham on fullyhacks at 2:30 in the morning
ct: good to know , kinda just stumbled on it and been playing around with it pretty cool, feel like it’d come in handy for calc 3 but my teacher doesn’t allow laptops lol
jasonw: and yea if you plan to do any math beyond calc 2 or something then some profs make u use it
jasonw: so it depends on what you think a reward is
jasonw: what it does not do is make ur resume look better for free or get u more interviews
joel: on arch btw
joel: id just use rust
jasonw: the only reward is that its easier to version control on git or something, it's a little more consistent abt some shit, and it's a weird ass cs major flex to talk about how you have to compile ur resume
ethanthatonekid: and better maintainability potentially 🙂
ethanthatonekid: that being said, i used google docs to write my resume. i’d recommend starting with that and perhaps trying to copy it over to latex as an exercise.
ethanthatonekid: i think latex being cross disciplinary makes the reward ratio better <:hackerfrank:928791616037216317>
ethanthatonekid: but by “learn” latex i don’t necessarily mean memorize it to the point where you can write it by heart. moreso just understand what it is capable of and how to use it so the next time you interact with any latex, you have a head start.
ethanthatonekid: it’s worth learning latex syntax for future use outside of building your portfolio. meaning using latex to build your portfolio is good practice. it depends on how much math (or latex notation) you realistically see yourself using in your academic career. you shouldn’t stop yourself from learning though, it might be worth it to you.
ct: do you think the time to reward ratio is worth using latex for a resume?
cheesy: damn
joel: <a:catroomba:988948283705663488>
cheesy: hi

hallowsyves: jojo reference? golden ratio 🙀
cramik: ```
typedef __false_type std::__is_integer< _tp >::__type
```
cramik: https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/libstdc%2b%2b-v3/include/bits/cpp_type_traits.h

no m but lots of __
cramik: they made a triangle as well
cramik: [] just looks nicer to me, less function calls
cramik: i had posted 4.6.2 which is simple pointer but then it changed to _m_base()
cramik: im curious why the [] operator is different between gcc4.6.2 and 4.6.3
pillow: unless this is the standard library
pillow: “yeah just increment the __n_p_b_it_v variable thats all u need”
pillow: bro who names their variables like this
cramik: its ironic it needs like 3 calls for front()
cramik: to be exact (i'm assuming https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.6.3/libstdc++/api/a01116_source.html is accurate to c++)
ct: ah got it that makes sense thank you
jasonw: or a queue or whatever
jasonw: it exists so u can do shit like hot swap it with a data structure that doesnt support indexing for instance a linked list
jasonw: functionally they do the same thing
ct: in c++ is there a difference in .front() and the 0 index of something? like lists.front() vs lists[0]?
